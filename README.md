# 🛡️ Hi, I'm Adepashe Abdulwahab! 👋
### Aspiring Junior Cybersecurity Analyst (SOC L1 Focus)

I am a dedicated, entry-level professional transitioning into the Blue Team space, specializing in threat detection and incident handling. I am focused on mastering the practical skills needed to secure organizational assets.

- 🎓 **Currently Studying:** Cisco Networking Academy (Junior Cyber Security Analyst Career Path)
- 🎯 **Current Career Goal:** To secure a role as a Security Operations Center (SOC) Analyst L1 and contribute to real-time defense.


## 🧠 Core Competencies & Tools

My focus is on practical, hands-on defense (Blue Team) and network security fundamentals.

| Category | Tools & Concepts |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Network Analysis** | **Wireshark** (Traffic inspection, protocol analysis) |
| **Security Architecture** | **Cisco Packet Tracer** (Network design, ACL implementation, security hardening) |
| **Virtualization** | **VirtualBox** (Creating and managing secure test environments) |
| **Concepts** | Incident Response Lifecycle, Threat Intelligence, Basic Log Analysis |



## 💡 Active Learning & Pipeline

I am prioritizing documentation and theoretical mastery while preparing for intensive hands-on labs. My immediate project pipeline focuses on bridging theory with practical application:

* **Documentation in Progress:** Drafting detailed Incident Response Playbooks (e.g., Phishing and Unauthorized Access) to demonstrate procedural knowledge. *(See my **[Documents Repository]** coming soon.)*
* **Targeted Hands-on Practice (Jan/Feb 2026):** Upon hardware upgrade, I will be immediately implementing:
    * **SIEM Lab Setup:** Deploying Splunk Free/Community Edition for log ingestion and correlation.
    * **Packet Analysis Projects:** Completing multiple documented threat analysis challenges using Wireshark and public pcap files.
